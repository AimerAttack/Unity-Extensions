Finite State Machine

FSM in game development is a necessory paradigm and aids in development and implementation of a lot of behaviours including animation system, AI, MenuManager, SoundManager, Game Manager and more. This specific implementation uses Unity3D's call back methods to implement states and their transitions. It contains two scripts State.cs and StateImplementor.cs. Any Script which requiers FSM behaviour, can implement StateImplementor class.
